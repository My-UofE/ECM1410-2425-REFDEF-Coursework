# ECM1410-2425-REFDEF-Coursework

The ECM1410 REFDEF coursework follows the a modified version of the coursework given in term 2 but with different games types and score systems.

(See the PDF for full instructions)

Instead of WORDMASTER and DICEROLL, the games options (and scoring systems) are:

### WORDLE

 - The result of a WORDLE game for an individual is a score between 0-6 indicating the number of guesses taken to guess a secret word. The fewer guesses the better, however a score of 0 indicates the person failed the game.
 -  To allocate league points each day the player(s) with the lowest non-zero game score wins (i.e. ranking is in order of score low to high) and the winner(s) get awarded 3 league points, the other player(s) in the group with a non-zero score awarded 1 league point. 

or

### TETRIS

 - the result of a TETRIS game for an individual is a score indicating how many levels the player completed in the daily TETRIS game. 
 - To allocate league points each day the player(s) with the greatest score wins (i.e. ranking is in order of score high to low) and the winner(s) get awarded 1 league point. No other players are awarded league points.
